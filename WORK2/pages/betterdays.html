    </h2>
    <p>
        After her classmate, Hu Xiaodie, commits suicide because of school bullying, Chen Nian finds herself as the new victim of the "queen bee" and vicious school bully, Wei Lai, along with her friends. When Chen Nian witnesses teenage thug Liu Beishan, also known as "Xiao Bei," being assaulted by rival thugs, she attempts to call the police but is attacked by the thugs as well. They force her to kiss Xiao Bei as a way to humiliate them.

Chen Nian’s school bullies grow fiercer, physically attacking her and spreading rumors about her family. Police detectives Zheng Ye and Lao Yang investigate Hu Xiaodie’s death and reveal that Chen Nian has reported being bullied. As a consequence, Wei Lai and her friends are suspended from school. Enraged, the three expelled bullies chase Chen Nian one day with boxcutters and a cage of rats. With nowhere else to turn, she seeks refuge at Xiao Bei’s house and asks him to protect her while she studies for the college entrance exam. He agrees and accompanies her to and from school each day, and during this time, the two grow close.

Xiao Bei is picked to be in a lineup and ends up stuck at the police station. Without his protection, Chen Nian is caught by the bullies; they cut her hair, beat her, and strip her, all while filming. When Xiao Bei is finally released, he rushes home to find a bleeding Chen Nian in tatters. He assists her in shaving her head and shaves his own in solidarity.

On the day of the exam, heavy rain causes a landslide. While clearing the landslide, Wei Lai's body is discovered. After the first day of the two-day exam, the detectives question Chen Nian as the main suspect in Wei Lai’s murder. They ask her why she didn’t come to them after the video of her was filmed; she states that she simply wants to take her exam and move away to Beijing for college.

As she's being escorted home by police, Xiao Bei grabs Chen Nian, and they run. He explains that the only way for her to go to college is if he takes the blame for Wei Lai's death. Reluctantly, Chen Nian agrees, and he acts as though he's assaulting her, leading to his arrest.

A flashback reveals Wei Lai begging Chen Nian not to report the video to the police. When Chen Nian pushes her in anger after she persists, Wei Lai falls down the stairs, hitting her head and dying. In the present, Chen Nian and Xiao Bei are interrogated but maintain that the only time they had met was when Xiao Bei attacked Chen Nian.

After Chen Nian receives her exam score, the detective informs her that Xiao Bei has been sentenced to death. Distraught, Chen Nian admits her involvement in the crime. The detective reveals that he lied to her to get her to confess, as the sentence would be lighter for both of them. He takes her to see Xiao Bei, and they agree to accept the lighter sentences; both end up in jail.

A few years later, Chen Nian is a teacher. She notices a distressed child, and they walk home together, closely followed by Xiao Bei. Screens explain the policies enacted by the Chinese government since the incident to prevent bullying in schools and impose stricter punishments on school bullies. Finally, there's a plea for everyone to take responsibility for the youth and their safety.
